# R6-Sword-ML-Animator
A machine learning system that generates procedural sword combat animations for Roblox games. Given a slash pattern (e.g., diagonal 1→9, overhead 2→8), the model produces keyframe sequences for R6 character rigs. Built with PyTorch and trained on extracted Moon Animator data.
